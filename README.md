Lobby
=====

> Could all new deployments please wait in the lobby. Your worker will be with you soon.

Lobby is a little RPC service for isolating and automating software deployments.

It doesnâ€™t handle versioning, statuses or anything related to workflow. Its single responsibility is to be a trigger for pushing out code.
